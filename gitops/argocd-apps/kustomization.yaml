# This patch enforces a standardized sync policy for Argo CD applications:
# - Enables automated sync with pruning (removes orphaned resources) and self-healing.
# - Adds a finalizer to ensure proper cascading deletion.
# - Automatically creates namespaces if they donâ€™t exist.
# - Retains up to 4 revision history records.
# - Implements a retry strategy:
#   - Retries failed syncs up to 3 times.
#   - Uses an exponential backoff (starting at 5s, doubling each time).
#   - Capped at a maximum wait time of 3 minutes.
# - Applies to all Application resources.
